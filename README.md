This repositories contains the initial 
condition and the large-scale forcing 
to reproduce the Shallow Cumulus(ShCu)
convection in Central Amazon(CAMZ). 

The initial conditions, large-scale forcing, and surface 
fluxes for the Amazon ShCu data set were created, 
averaging data set from the six representative 
cases of ShCu in CAMZ.
